# Using

## Installing

Before you can do anything, the project must have its dependencies installed. Make sure you have [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed, then run `pnpm install` at the project root to grab all deps.

## Linting

You can lint the whole project by running `pnpm lint` in the root of the project.

## Testing

You can test the whole project by running `pnpm test` in the root of the project. You can lint individual packages by navigating to one (such as `apps/express-backend`) and running `npm run test` or `npm run test:watch` in its directory.

## Running express-backend

- cd to `apps/express-backend`
- Run the app with `npm run start`
